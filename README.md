## Rettoph's ComputerCraft Scripts!
A simple collection of scripts i think are useful for setting up new computercraft worlds.

### Setup
This repo allows you to edit and automatically publish scripts to your CC computers, to setup simply:
- Install Posh-SSH:
  - `PS > Install-Module -Name Posh-SSH`
- Configure `remote.config.json`. 
  - Use (`remote.config.json.example`)[remote.config.json.example] as an example
- Install recommended plugins
- Run Launch profile: `Force Sync: All`

Once complete, your files should be uploaded to the sftp location on save.
